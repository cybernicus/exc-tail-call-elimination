# Example [C]: Tail call elimination

Trivial example of a C program that uses tail call elimination.

NOTE: While it's a C example, my makefile specifies C++ '11.  Just a
habit of mine--I pretty much always use C++ or C-style under C++.

LICENSE: There's absolutely no IP in here, as it's just an example of
information you can already find anywhere on the net.  I just packed
it into a format where I can get it easily when I forget.  So feel free
to do anything you like with it.
